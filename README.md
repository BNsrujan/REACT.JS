# React.js Learning Project

This repository contains various React.js examples and learning materials covering fundamental concepts and features of React.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several components and examples:

### Core Components
- `App.jsx` - Main application component
- `Header.jsx` - Header component
- `Footer.jsx` - Footer component
- `Card.jsx` - Reusable card component
- `Food.jsx` - Food-related component

### React Concepts Examples
1. **Props and Components**
   - `Props.jsx` - Demonstrates prop passing
   - `Student.jsx` - Example of component props usage

2. **State Management**
   - `ReactHook.jsx` - React Hooks examples
   - `updatearryofobjectinstate.jsx` - State array manipulation
   - `updateFunction.jsx` - State update functions

3. **Event Handling**
   - `clickevent.jsx` - Click event handling
   - `onChange.jsx` - Form input handling

4. **Conditional Rendering**
   - `conditional-redering.jsx` - Conditional component rendering
   - `UserGreeting.jsx` - Conditional user greeting

5. **Lists and Arrays**
   - `list.jsx` - List rendering
   - `ToDoList.jsx` - Todo list implementation

6. **Effects and Side Effects**
   - `useEffext.jsx` - useEffect hook examples
   - `seeHightWidethusingUseEffect.jsx` - Window dimensions using useEffect

7. **UI Components**
   - `Colourpicker.jsx` - Color picker component
   - `Btn/` - Button components directory

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Features

- Component-based architecture
- State management examples
- Event handling demonstrations
- Conditional rendering
- List rendering
- React Hooks usage
- Form handling
- UI component examples

## Learning Resources

This project serves as a practical learning resource for:
- React component structure
- Props and state management
- Event handling
- React Hooks
- Conditional rendering
- List rendering
- Form handling
- UI component development

## Notes

- Each component is designed to demonstrate specific React concepts
- Components can be uncommented in `App.jsx` to see their functionality
- The project includes examples of different styling approaches (External, Modules, Inline)
